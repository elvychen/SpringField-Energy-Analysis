     Because not knowing a lot of knowledge about powers/industry, so I cannot design my visualization closely related to powers/industry. The graphs contain too much data. Therefore, it is hard for people who want to get the data of a certain time directly. Also, the rooftop solar does not have history data. Therefore, it is not included in the graph. Besides this, exports and pumps do not have powers in certain period. The data we got is about a week. Therefore, it cannot tell the trends of this industry.  
     One limitation is that the visualizations requires server. It cannot be opened index.html directly. 
     In the beginning, I was not sure how to synchronize the charts. I did not have any other experiences using HighChart and javascript before this class and only knew a little bit structure for HTML and CSS. Because of these reasons, I spent a lot of time working on this assignment. I did not sure how to hide and show the pie and bar charts. But then I went to TA's office hours and got some hints. 
     Beside this, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to click the name of on the chart to take away that series of the data and update the table, pie chart, and bar chart. Also, setting the layout of charts took me a lot of time because it presented differently in Google Chrome and Safari. 

Please check!:
1. Click one each power in the table and check the line, bar, pie charts and data in the table. 
2. Click on the arrow for price and temperature
3. Make the mouse leave the chart on the left
